Program description:
A Port Scanner is a program for tcp/ip based networks
like the internet or the wide/local area network(W/LAN).
It tests a host for running services like ftp, telnet or
even backdoors. It's similar to somebody who goes over a
parking and touches every doorknob to test if the door
is open. The ports are the doors of the cars. Some of
the ports are mostly uses for special services like
the port #21 which is normaly reserved for ftp services.

This PortScanner for Windows95/98/ME/NT/2k/XP supports
the TCP and UDP protocol. It can scan a single host
or a range of ip-addresses. Either you define a range of
ports(e.g. 1-5000) or you can create a list of ports to
scan. Thereto you have to check the
"Scan ports from list" checkbox.

If you enter an IP like "156.233.56.22:555" the 555
will be automatically cut off and passed into the
start or end port text field.

To edit/load/save/create a list, click on
the "Show list" botton.

The "Anti-Flood" function protects the scanner from
being flooded ifthe host is sending much data on an
open port to any client. It limits its answer message
to 145 bytes.

The "Ping check" should be only deactivated if the
host is not reachable, when you just know that it is
alive in truth. If you deactivate this function,
the "Auto pipeline control" function will be also
deactivated and this will decrease the scan speed!!
Burst mode is only useful for short scans(5000ports)
on fast computers, because it can cause false reports
especially when doing and UDP scan.

By clicking on the "?" symbol you can open the port list.
With right-clicking on it you can select one of the three
different search fuctions. You can also open the list by
double-clicking on the start or end port text field.
If you than double-click on a port of opened list this port
will be writen down in the port field you have double-
clicked at first.

You can open the history list of successful scanned hosts
by double.clicking on the IP/Domain/Name fields.
The history lists also offers a popup menu in which you
can delete entries, load a new one or save the current.

At least I want give you the tip to check all text fields
for a context menu, because most of the functions are
only attainable over a popup menu!
