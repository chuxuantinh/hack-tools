#             Code Blue              #
As of now Code Blue can gain access
to most LE Bluetooth devices and 
preform scans to locate sources for
information. Sadly the python module
is a bit glitchly with the latest iOS
update so connections to gather the info
are not working (I've been trying for
4 hours), so for now it mainly accesses
and then shows services.

`The Future`
I am _pretty_ sure if they can fix up
the Bluetooth module soon then I can get
the data to respond back to the phone.
Right now other apps like: **NTB** can
run full accessed scans, but sadly
pythonista can't yet. It is going to be
pretty sick once I can get it up and
running!
