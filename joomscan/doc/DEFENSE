HOW TO DEFENSE
===============

In case if you,guys, want to protect from OWASP Joomla! Vulnerability Scanner
being used by malicious attackers, you may want to deploy the following free defensive solutions:

1. Use the .htaccess located in the same directory
   http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/misc/modrewrite-securityrule.php
    
2. Use PHP Attack Detection Engine
   http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/files.php/php_brute_force_detect.zip

But they are not guaranteed solutions for advanced attackers.
