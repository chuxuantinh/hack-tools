OWASP Joomla! Vulnerability Scanner CHANGELOG 
=============================================

Changes in v0.0.4

- Added database contribution by web-center.si
  Total update entries are now 611.
  Thank you, web-center, for updating!
  
  
Changes in v0.0.3

- updated fingerprinting signatures up to current Joomla! version 1.5.14
- updated vulnerability information up to August 18, 2009

- Implemented 200 defense bypass

  This is bypass web servers which respond with 200 for every 404,  which makes the scanner,
  produce very noisy reports about false positives. 200 defense can render today's most scanners useless.

- Added more Joomla!-based firewall detection
- Added anti-caching mechanism in update check
- Refined HTML reporting with extremely-easy-to-deploy excellent cross-browser graphing functionality (Thanks, jscharts.com)
- Add a beep sound after finishing the scanning. It acts like an alarm - "Scanning's over. Look the result!"
  This is my personal preference. Running hacking tools takes long sometimes depending on
  various situations and we can't know how long it will take and when it finishes.  
  

Changes in v0.0.2

- Changed report location.
  This version will save report under report/ directory.
- Removed "Poke Version" -pv command option
  Version fingerprinting is run by default now till the future versions
  But you can skip it using -nv (No version check) option
  
  - improved fingerprinting engine to find more exact version and to provide most approximate version range
  without making you calculate it anymore. Please see the sample output below:

[Fingerprint in 0.0.1]
	~Generic version family ....... [1.5.x]
	~1.5.x htaccess.txt revealed [1.5.4 - 1.5.11]
	~1.5.x configuration.php-dist revealed [1.5.1 - 1.5.8]
	~1.5.x en-GB.xml revealed [1.5.2 - 1.5.6]
	~1.5.x en-GB.ini revealed [1.5.4 - 1.5.7]
[/Fingerprint in 0.0.1]
For the above output, you will have to think the most approximate range again.

[Fingerprint in 0.0.2]
	~Generic version family ....... [1.5.x]

	~1.5.x htaccess.txt revealed [1.5.4 - 1.5.11]
	~1.5.x configuration.php-dist revealed [1.5.1 - 1.5.8]
	~1.5.x en-GB.xml revealed [1.5.2 - 1.5.6]
	~1.5.x en-GB.ini revealed [1.5.4 - 1.5.7]
	~1.5.x admin en-GB.com_config.ini revealed [1.5.4 - 1.5.6]
	~1.5.x admin en-GB.ini revealed [1.5.5 - 1.5.7]
	~1.5.x adminlists.html revealed [1.5.0(stable) - 1.5.6]

	* Deduced version range is : [1.5.5 - 1.5.6]
[/Fingerprint in 0.0.1]
You need to look at only deduced version range, which has been calculated for most approximate range.
