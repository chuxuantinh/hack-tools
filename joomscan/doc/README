Description
===========

Joomla! is probably the most widely-used CMS out there due to its flexibility, user-friendlinesss, extensibility to name a few.So, watching its vulnerabilities and adding such vulnerabilities as KB to Joomla scanner takes ongoing activity.It will help web developers and web masters to help identify possible security weaknesses on their deployed Joomla! sites. No web security scanner is ever dedicated only one CMS.

HOW TO UPDATE
===============
SVN checkout is always recommended more than checking from the scanner which is
good for new database updates and slight changes in the scanner itself.

svn co https://joomscan.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/joomscan/trunk joomscan

OR 
joomscan.pl update
joomscan.pl check

GENERAL NOTE
============
Result files are saved as TARGET-joexploit.htm or TARGET-joexploit.txt 
under report/ directory of joomscan.pl .

You're recommended to check updates once a month at least.
This scanner is supposed to have abilitiy to check for both Joomla! and Mambo CMS.
It's not perfect. You're requested to post any bugs to joomscan[4t]yehg.net.

I included my accidently-found vulnerabilities in two components.
I'm sure there are thousands unpublished out there. 
So when you're free, play with Joomla! components and let me know your nice finds.

Finally, full disclosure is the only way to stop the hole or worsen the world.
